# How to contribute

**What do we do?**

Education and communications around the value of Monero. This involves writing, creating educational material and completing other general Monero tasks.

**Join one of our chats and introduce yourself:**
- What part of the world are you from?
- Any other involvements in the crypto space?
- What you would love to get suck in with?

**Open an Issue**

 - Share us your ideas.
 - Add a CONTRIBUTING.md guide.
 - Fork the repo and add your initiative in a seperate directory. It can be anything, from graphic design, artwork, articles, economic reports, guides, or even educational online initiatives. 
 - Help us complete Monero Outreach tasks. Go to the [Monero Outreach Taiga instance](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/) and read the [Epic/Tutorial](https://taiga.getmonero.org/project/xmrhaelan-monero-public-relations/epic/26) and start on working!
